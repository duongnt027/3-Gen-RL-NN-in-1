I haven't finished it yet, but if you want to give it a try, you can just take the code and replace the PPO and main training files. Thanks for your interest.

Here are some hints I can give you
- Python 3.11
- Libraries listed in requirements.txt
- All code can be run on Kaggle

Motip:
- Use GENAI to generate data for dataset
- Use NN for detection
- Use RL to learn how to make new data
